## What is it?

Caterva is an open source C library and a format that allows to store large
multidimensional, chunked, compressed datasets. Data can be stored either
in-memory or on-disk, but the API to handle both versions is the same.
Compression is handled transparently for the user by adopting the Blosc2 library.
