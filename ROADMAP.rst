Roadmap
=======

This document lists the main goals for the upcoming python-caterva releases.


Features
--------

* *Support for variable-length metalayers*.
  This would provide users a lot of flexibility to define their own metadata

* *Resize array dimensions*.
  This feature would allow Caterva to increase or decrease in size any dimension of the arrays.


Interoperability
----------------

* *Third-party integration*. Caterva need better integration with libraries like:

    * xarray (labeled arrays)
    * dask (computation)
    * napari (visualization)
